\section*{System architecture}
Our system uses a server-client architecture.
This means that each client only talks to the server,
and the server is therefore responsible for handling joining and leaving clients.
The clients therefore also don't need to know anything about the other client.
When a client sends a message, it is sent to the server which then distributes the message to all clients.

\section*{RPC Methods}
We have one method in the .proto 

\section*{Lamport timestamps}
We have implemented Lamport timestamps 

\section*{Traces of RPC calls}
